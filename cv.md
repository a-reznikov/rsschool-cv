## About me:
I was born in Svetlogorsk in 1990, and I am now 32 years old. For ten years I lived in Mogilev, where I studied at the BRU and worked at the Skoda dealership. Then my wife and I moved to Gomel, where I worked at the Skoda dealership, and then at Wurth. And for the last five years we have been living in this city. I have a lot of experience in sales and interpersonal relationships.
I love running, reading books and information technology. My main goal is to get a job at an IT company.
